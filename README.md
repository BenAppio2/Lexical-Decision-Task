# Instructions
In this experiment, the participant will be presented with four letter words that may or may not be apart of the english language.
The words are presented for a short period of time, and the participant uses the left or right arrow keys to decide if they think it is considered a word or not.
After the experiment loop runs through, they will be presented to select if they enjoyed the experiment or not.
